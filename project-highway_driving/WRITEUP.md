## Project: **Highway driving** 

Design a path planner that is able to create smooth, safe paths for the car to follow along a 3 lane highway with traffic. A successful path planner will be able to keep inside its lane, avoid hitting other cars, and pass slower moving traffic all by using localization, sensor fusion, and map data.

## Setup & Useful notes

### Compilation and run

* Ensure GPU mode is activated
* Start VM and simulation
* mkdir build && cd build
* cmake .. && make
* ./path_planning
