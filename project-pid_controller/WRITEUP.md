## Project: **PID Controller** 

Implement a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track!.

[Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1972/view) points to be adressed for this writeup:
* Your code should compile.
* The PID procedure follows what was taught in the lessons.
* Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.
* Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.
* The vehicle must successfully drive a lap around the track.
